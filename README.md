# Python-Vowel-Counter
Vowel counter program written in Python that I submitted as an assignment for my [Python Programming course](https://www.futurelearn.com/microcredentials/cisco-python-programming).

## Input and Processing
The program reads in the contents of a .txt file as input. Currently the program reads in the file named Jabberwocky.txt which is stored in the same directory as the Python code file in this repository. The file may be changed but the code calls the file by name so must be changed to reflect this. The contents of the file are then looped through as the program counts the number of lower case vowels and upper case vowels which it stores in a dictionary to later be output to the user.

## Output
The ouput is shown below:<br><br>

## Areas to improve (with more time)
Flexability change: Allow the user to enter the .txt file name while the program is running so that if the user wishes to check a different .txt file, they do not need to alter the code.
